Mentor: Neela Santosh
Description:  Objective
The primary objective of this mini project is to design a 16x8-bit synchronous RAM block that allows:
Writing data to a memory location,Reading data from a memory location,Verifying behavior using a simulation testbenchThrough this project, the goal is to provide hands-on experience with
,Synchronous digital logic,Register arrays,Memory access operations,Writing and interpreting simulation testbenches and waveforms.

Tools Used:
Verilog HDL: Language used to write the RAM design and testbench.

Icarus Verilog (iverilog): Free Verilog compiler used to compile and simulate the code.

GTKWave: Waveform viewer used to inspect signal behavior during simulation.

Visual Studio Code: Code editor used to write and organize the Verilog project.

Applications:
Digital Design Education: Useful for students learning about memory structures in computer architecture.

Embedded Systems: RAM is crucial in microcontrollers and SoC design.

FPGA/ASIC Prototyping: Forms a fundamental part of custom hardware logic.

Cache Memory Simulations: Can be extended for cache modeling and interfacing.

Conclusion:
This RAM project has provided a strong foundational experience in hardware modeling using Verilog HDL. It has not only demonstrated how memory modules operate at the gate/register level but also introduced simulation-driven development. The testbench confirms that the RAM behaves as expected under various scenarios, making it suitable for further extension into larger digital systems like processors, memory controllers, and more.

Through the use of open-source tools and a structured approach, the project reinforces key concepts in digital design and gives students a pathway to understanding how memory works within hardware systems.
